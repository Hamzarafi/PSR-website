                    Think of an issue that needs to be settled. Unless you’re playing 
                    for amusement’s sake, some issue will normally be hanging in the balance.
                    Maybe you’re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza, or who 
                    should be first in line to try out a new waterslide. In most cases,
                    Rock, Paper, Scissors is played as a means to help make a choice or
                    put an end to a disagreement. The idea is that both players have an 
                    equal chance of winning, making the game random but fair.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rock, Paper, Scissors can be used to decide anything from what movie
                        you see with your friends to who should inherit a collection of priceless paintings.</li>
                    <li>While patterns do emerge during gameplay, they are neutralized by the 
                        unpredictability of the other player’s choice.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>
            <img src="make-a-crazy-bet.jpg" style="size: 100%; width: 400px; height: 250px;"/>
            <img src="Options.jpg" style="size: 100%; width: 400px; height: 250px;"/>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Face off against another person. For the game to play out correctly, there need to be two players.
                    Stand facing one another a few paces apart. Place one hand flat out in front of you, palm up. Your 
                    other hand will be used to make the shape of the object you want to play once the game starts.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rock, Paper, Scissors can only be played by two people at a time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Count down to make your play. Agree on a cue that you’ll use to match shapes
                    with your opponent. In the majority of games, the players throw their shape on 
                    the count of three (sometimes counted off by reciting each word of the game’s title).
                    You can also count down by saying “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On the word “shoot,” 
                    both players reveal the object they chose.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tap your closed playing hand against your palm as you count down.
                        This will help you and your opponent get synchronized.</li>
                    <li>Be sure that you’re on the same page as far as timing your plays.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <img src="countdown.png" style="size: 100%; width: 300px; height: 300px;"/>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Play one of the three objects against your opponent. When it comes time to 
                    play, you and your opponent will each form one of the three objects—either 
                    rock, paper or scissors. You’ll then name a winner based on which object they
                    played. Every game will be different, so stay alert!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both players must throw at the same time. If one player delays, the 
                        result isn’t trustworthy, and you should start the game over.</li>
                    <li>Don’t play the same object every time. Switch it up to fool your opponent.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Determine the winner. After you’ve both played an object, look to see who’s won. 
                    Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes”
                    scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, 
                    and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger 
                    of the two objects is the winner.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, simply 
                        play again until there is a clear winner.</li>
                    <li>The loser of the game has the right to call for “best 2 out of 3,” meaning 
                        that 3 rounds will be played instead of just 1. This gives the losing player
                        a chance to come out on top.</li>
                </ul>
